\chapter{$DC_C$ Implementation}
%- general structure of impl
%  - constraint system solved with SMT solver
%  - SMT solver input is SMTLib format
%  - "connection" to smt solver simple external process call
%- constraint system in DCc given as sequent calculus
%- in order to use SMT on constraint system
%  → transform sequent calculus into first order axioms
%  → use SMTlib representation of these axioms as input to solver
In this chapter we show our implementation of the $DC_C$ Calculus presented in \Cref{sec:dcc}.
We use Scala~\cite{scala} for the implementation.
The constraint system will be solved using SMT with Z3 prover~\cite{z3}.
