\subsubsection{Dependent Object Types (DOT)}
DOT~\cite{dot1,dot2} is a calculus
modeling Scalas path-dependent types and abstract type members.
It uses refinement types to model the mixture of
nominal and structural typing in Scala.
DOT normalizes the type system of Scala
through the unification of the constructs for type members.
It provides intersection and union types
to simplify the computations for greatest lowerbounds
and least upperbounds.
DOT is at the core of \textit{dotty},
a compiler for Scala under development since 2013
considered for inclusion in Scala 3.

\subsubsection{Veritas}
VeriTaS~\cite{veritas1,veritas2} is an ongoing project
for the specification and verification
of domain-specific languages (DSL).
VeriTaS is aimed at automatically proving type soundness 
using first-order theorem proving.
It allows for specifying
the syntax and semantics of DSL
and proof goals and axioms.
It includes a compiler to translate
these language specifications and the proof goals on them
and proofs can be structured via proof graphs.
