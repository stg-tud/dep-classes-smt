\subsubsection{Veritas}
VeriTaS~\cite{veritas1,veritas2} is an ongoing project
for the specification and verification
of domain-specific languages (DSL).
VeriTaS is aimed at automatically proving type soundness 
using first-order theorem proving.
It allows for specifying
the syntax and semantics of DSL
and proof goals and axioms.
It includes a compiler to translate
these language specifications and the proof goals on them
and proofs can be structured via proof graphs.
