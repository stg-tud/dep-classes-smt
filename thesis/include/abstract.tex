- dependent classes
  - support:
  - dynamic dispatch (polymorphic methods)
  - inheritance
  - on the level of groups of related classes
- DCC calculus extends the semantics of dependent classes with abstract classes and methods
  and expresses inheritance through a constraint system
- we implement the DCC calculus
- and solve the constraint system by using SMT solving
- we propose "context enrichment" as a process
  of transferring compile time information to the runtime of a program
  to increase the performance of the constraint system solving
