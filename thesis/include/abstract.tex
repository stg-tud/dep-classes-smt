Dependent Classes support typical
object oriented techniques
as inheritance and subtype polymorphism
at the scope of class groups.
The $DC_C$ calculus extends the semantics
of Dependent Classes with
abstract classes and methods
and expresses inheritance via a constraint system.

We implement the $DC_C$ calculus in Scala
and utilize SMT solving to solve its constraint system.
We propose \textit{context enrichment} as a process
to transfer information from compile time to runtime
%to the constraint entailment to be solved during runtime.
to decrease the time to solve constraint entailments emerging during runtime.

%  - inheritance
