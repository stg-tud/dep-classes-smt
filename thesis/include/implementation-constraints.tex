\section{Constraint System}
\label{sec:constraintsystem}
The $DC_C$ constraint system as presented in \Cref{fig:dcc-constraint-entailment}
is specified in the style of the sequent calculus.
In order to use a SMT solver on the constraint system
we model the sequent calculus in sorted first-order logic.
The integration of the SMT solving with the Scala implementation
is done via calling the SMT solver as a sub-process and using
the SMT-Lib format for communicating information between
the Scala implementation and the solver process.

%- fo syntax description for special stuff
%  - pattern matching
%  - let bindings
%  - if statements (inline + multiline)
%  - sort (type) specifications
%  - parametrized list type
%  - pretty printing of sort constructors
In sorted first order logic variables are not limited to a single domain.
Variable bindings (e.g. in quantifiers)
have an assigned sort as seen in \Cref{fig:smtlib-example-fo},
where the all-quantified variable $x$ has the sort \mIt{List[Int]}.
The notion for such a sorted variable is $x: S$
for variables $x$ and sorts $S$.

\begin{align*}
&\mIt{elem}(c: \Constr, cs: \Constrs): Bool = cs \match\\
&\quad \case{\nil}{false}\\
&\quad \case{hd :: tl}{\ite{c = hd}{true}{\mIt{elem}(c, tl)}}\\\\
&\mIt{concat}(l_1: \Constrs, l_2: \Constrs): \Constrs = l_1 \match\\
&\quad \case{\nil}{l_2}\\
&\quad \case{hd :: tl}{hd :: \mIt{concat}(tl, l_2)}
\end{align*}

We also use let-bindings, if statements, pattern matching and primitive recursive functions.
Let bindings are written with the keywords \Let and \textbf{in}.
If statements can be written inline as \ite{b}{x}{y} or using
the keywords \If, \Then and \textbf{else}.
Pattern matching is written using the notion $x \match$ to start matching some $x$
and patterns are specified using \case{y}{z},
where variables occurring in $y$ are bound in $z$.
Pattern matching can be written as a combination of if statements and let bindings
and is therefore used for better readability.

The parametrized sort \mIt{List} models lists and
is predefined in Z3.
The constructor $\nil$ represents the empty list and
the constructor \mIt{insert} is used for list constructions
and \mIt{insert(x, l)} will also be written as $x :: l$
for elements $x$ and lists $l$ with matching sorts.
Selectors \mIt{head} and \mIt{tail} are used to extract
the head and tail from a list.
We write $[x_1, ..., x_n]$ as a shortcut for
$x_1 :: ... :: x_n :: \nil$ for lists with elements $\{x_i | i > 0 \land i \leq n\}$.
\Cref{fig:fo-list-funs} defines functions for list concatenation
as well as element-of checking.
We write $l_1 \conc l_2$ for concatenating two lists $l_1$ and $l_2$
and $x \in l$ for checking if element $x$ is in list $l$.
